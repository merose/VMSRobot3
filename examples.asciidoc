| Name | Challenges

| FollowWall | Make sure the robot does not turn so sharply that it gets hung up as it rounds a corner.
| Wander | Can you make the robot wander faster without running into anything? Or, can you make it go slower and make it better able to avoid narrow things like table legs?
| FollowObject | Can you make it smarter about following? For example, continuing to the left if it loses an object while turning left, instead of always trying to the right?
| PushObject | Can you keep the robot from getting stuck in a corner? How about keeping it from getting stuck without seeing an object, endlessly circling?

== Remote Control

The RemoteControl example requires the use of the GoBLE app which can be installed for free on an iPhone or iPad from the Apple Store. You have to press the search button to find your robot, then select it to connect. After that you can use the virtual joystick to drive the robot around.
