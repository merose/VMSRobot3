# VMSRobot3
Software library for the third generation robot for the Valley Montessori Middle School robotics elective.

# Software Installation
The software in this repository is designed to be an Arduino library.

## Installing Using Git
* Go to the Arduino *libraries/* directory.
* Clone this repository into that directory. (Will normally be a subdirectory called *VMSRobot3*, but you can use a different name, if you prefer.)
* Restart the Arduino IDE. Examples from this library should be available in the File > Examples > VMSRobot3 menu.

## Installing from ZIP
* There are no releases yet. For now, use the *Download ZIP* button and unpack that ZIP file into the Arduino *libraries/* directory. That will create a subdirectory called *VMSRobot3-master*.
* Rename that directory to *VMSRobot3*.
* Restart the Arduino IDE. Examples from this library should be available in the File > Examples > VMSRobot3 menu.

[Laser cutting template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1_iFljgq8uCeUViWE9STkExa00/view?usp=sharing) - The cut lines are in yellow and are hard to see, but that works best with the *raster then vector* etch/cut mode in the laser cutter I'm using. You may want to darken the lines in Gimp or Photoshop, and perhaps remove the VMS logo. The original is in OmniGraffle, available upon request.
