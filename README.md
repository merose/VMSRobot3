[Laser cutting template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1_iFljgq8uCeUViWE9STkExa00/view?usp=sharing) - The cut lines are in yellow and are hard to see, but that works best with the *raster then vector* etch/cut mode in the laser cutter I'm using. You may want to darken the lines in Gimp or Photoshop, and perhaps remove the VMS logo. The original is in OmniGraffle, available upon request.
